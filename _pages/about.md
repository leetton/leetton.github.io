<!-- I am a final-year Ph.D. student of Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Prof. Jie Xiong. I also work with Prof. Sunghoon Ivan Lee and Prof. Jeremy Gummeson. I am broadly interested in building novel wireless sensing systems using a variety of sensing modalities, including acoustics, Wi-Fi, mmWave, UWB, and RFID. My research mainly includes localization and tracking, human-computer interaction, and health sensing. -->
