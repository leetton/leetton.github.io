<h2>CMSC 491/691 Mobile Computing and Wireless Sensing (Fall 2024)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rapid expansion of mobile and wireless technologies, alongside breakthroughs in deep learning, has led to the emergence of the “Artificial Intelligence of Things” (AIoT). In this cutting-edge paradigm, wireless signals do more than just facilitate communication between devices—they also enable interaction with people and the physical environment. This course provides an in-depth exploration of key concepts in mobile and wireless sensing, including the fundamentals of wireless signals, signal processing techniques, and machine learning algorithms.
    The course is structured into six comprehensive modules, each focused on a specific application domain, such as localization and tracking, gesture and activity recognition, health sensing, material and environmental sensing, multi-modal sensing, and privacy-preserving sensing. Throughout the course, students will engage with recent research papers that highlight innovative designs, algorithms, and applications within the field of mobile and wireless sensing.
    A significant component of the course involves a semester-long, research-oriented project where students will gain hands-on experience by designing and building their own AIoT systems. This project will allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, fostering a deeper understanding of the AIoT landscape.
